    <textarea placeholder="The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE). Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets." class="text-sm p-2" cols="60" rows="10"></textarea>
